General Notes

A period spanning from 1990 to the present (November 2025) was selected arbitrarily as a period of significant enough length to be indicative of long term trends, and it was anticipated this period would demonstrate the most significant diversification of the makeup of electrical generation sources with the state of Ohio. 

Belleville Lock and Dam actually lacked observed temperature data, so it isn't included in the aggregate

Lunken airport lacked observed or average temp recordings for the majority of the period of interest, so observed max and min were used to 
approximate a daily average. for the portion of the dataset where a recorded daily average was available the approximation based on the max and min had a mean error of -0.15701984275552505
